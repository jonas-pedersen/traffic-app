# Project
This project was done to practise front-end and back-end. It shows the next departures with bus or train towards 3 different neighborhoods around a city in northern Sweden. The departures will update each minute.

## Run
From the terminal in the folder where you put this project do the following: 
Start up the app with the following command:
`npm run start`
Open [localhost](http://localhost:3000/) with port 3000.


### Please note
As of now the API that I'm using have limit of 10000 request per month. This app will use 3 request (one for each departure) each minute which means that it will be possible that the app doesn't work after a few days usage because of this limit.
